    A brief description of how you use and contribute to the Help Center.
    </p>

    <p>
    Welcome to the Help Center! This way of doing documentation is a bit
    different from what you may be used to, so please read this document
    to understand how to contribute.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Quick Start</h2>
    
    <p>For the impatient, here's the bare minimum you should know:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>You normally need to be logged in.</li>

        <li>There are several different documentation types, most are 
            self-explanatory, but pay attention to the difference between a
            <strong>How-to</strong> and a <strong>Tutorial</strong> (explained
            below).
        </li>

        <li>To add a piece of documentation/help, go into the relevant section,
            <strong>make sure there isn't already an existing entry about what
            you want to add</strong>,
            and use the button at the top right to add (normally says <code>Add 
            FAQ</code> or similar).
        </li>

        <li>Add your content, and save it. This edit/view cycle can be
            performed as many times as you like, until you are happy with the
            result.
        </li>

        <li>Make sure you <code>Submit</code> your document for publication
            when you are done &mdash; top right pulldown in the content area.
        </li>
        
        <li>A reviewer will then pick up the document, and publish it unless
            the content needs to be improved.
        </li>
            
        <li>If somebody adds comments to your entry later, you will be notified
            by e-mail.
        </li>
    </ol>    

    <h2>What type of item is my documentation?</h2>

    <p>Below is a description, usage and example for each type.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)</dt>

        <dd>
            <p>
            An FAQ is a short question with a 1-2 paragraph answer. You can add several
            questions to a FAQ area and group the questions into sections.
            </p>

                <strong>Question:</strong> What is Plone?

                <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong>
                Plone is an open source Enterprise Content Management
                System (ECM/CMS) that runs on top of Zope and CMF.

    <dl>
        <dt>HowTo</dt>

        <dd>
            <p>
            A HowTo is a one-page description on how to accomplish something, but is
    folderish, so Files/Images can be attached. It's usually very brief and to-the-point.
            </p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Typical How-Tos</legend>

                <ul>
                    <li>How to set up Plone with the Apache Web Server</li>
                    <li>How to change the tabs that appear at the top of the portal</li>
                </ul>
            </fieldset>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Tutorial</dt>

        <dd>
            <p>
            A tutorial is a multi-paged article with lots of detail. The tutorial
            is more in-depth than a How-to, and may cover the conceptual aspects
            of the task, in addition to the practical steps to get the job done.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you are unsure of the difference of a How-to and a Tutorial, think
            about it as the difference between a recipe that only teaches you 
            what ingredients are needed, and how to bake the cake (How-to),
            and an article telling you about the history behind cakes in general,
            that may or may not teach you how to actually bake one (Tutorial).

            <p>
                A help link is a link (either external or internal). It is
    different from a standard Plone link in that it can have section
    and version information.

            <p>
                An error reference is meant to be the explanation of a particular error, with details on how to fix it, if relevant.
            </p>

                A glossary definition describes a particular term used as 
                concisely as possible.
            </p>
