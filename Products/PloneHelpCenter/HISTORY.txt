History of changes to PHC (name of developer listed in brackets)::

    PloneHelpCenter 3.0b2

    - Make hc_view available in PSC.    

    PloneHelpCenter 3.0b1
    
    - View cleanups.

    PloneHelpCenter 3.0dev
    
    - Reduce test noise if LinguaPlone, i18ndude or i18ntestcase are
      missing. [stevem, thanks dukebody]
    
    - setuphandlers.py wasn't protecting importVarious from running in
      non-install contexts. Showed up as unable to find portal_registry
      when creating a new plone site. [stevem]
    
    - Added Upgrade profile to manage type transition. [stevem]
    
    - Updated all types to be derived from ATCT types, thus inheriting
      all the standard Plone behavior that PHC used to have to do on
      its own. [stevem]
    
    - Add a "Knowledge Base" that's basically a large folder to
      organize how-tos and tutorials. [stevem]

    PloneHelpCenter 1.6.1
    
    - Set up indices in Extensions/Install.py rather than via GS
      so that they won't be cleared on reinstall. [stevem]
    
    - Can't cache function results that have brains.
      [stevem]


    PloneHelpCenter 1.6
    
    - Added time-based ram caching to several expensive view methods.
      Default invalidation is 30 minutes, but may be changed in
      config.py.
      [stevem]
    
    - Plone 3.x is now required. PHC 1.5.x will be a maintenance branch. 
    
    - Add browser view support for a listing of start here docs by section.
      This is for Plone.Org, forthcoming documentation top page revision.
      [stevem]
    
    - The compact topic view no longer blocks the left column. That just isn't
      necessary for Plone 3.x.
      [stevem]


    PloneHelpCenter 1.5

    - Corrected a problem in the helpcenter_view that would cause a batching 
      error for non-PHC subcontent. [stevem]
    
    RC 2
    
    - Fix issue #95 -- Order of items is not respected -- by adding back
      some of the interfaces masked when marker interfaces were added
      during view implementation.
      [stevem]
    
    - Hacked up a solution to how-to attachment action buttons that works
      with 2.5 and 3.x. The is just a patch to hold until 2.5 compatibility
      is abandoned. Fixes issue 106.
      [stevem]
    
    - Unable to add attachments to how-tos. Fixed narrow issue; larger
      problem of actions remains.
      [stevem]
    
    - Expanded referenceable types to include all PHC leaf content types.
      Fixes 114.
      [stevem]
      
    RC 1
    
    - Eggified. [stevem]
    
    Beta 7
    
    - Add link to api.plone.org in list of additional resources. This
      fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7898.
      [vinsci]
    
    Beta 6
    
    - Restored getAudiencesVocab method to PHCFolder. It had been accidentally
      deleted in a recen refactoring. Fixes #93.
      [kteague]
      
    - The latest Archetypes changed the defaults for text fields, creating the
      possibility that content types other than plain text might be allowed 
      for some text-only fields. Fixed by specifying allowable and default
      content types. Fixes #99.
      [kteague]
      
    Beta 5 and earlier
    
    - Remove "statistics" tab from subfolders. I don't know if it
      was ever meant to be there, but it's useless and doesn't work.
      [stevem]
    
    - Move presentation support from PHCFolder.py to browser view.
      [stevem]
    
    - Items without sections were not showing in phcfolder_view.
      [stevem]
    
    - Revise utils.discussionNotify() to use secureSend.
      [stevem]
    
    - Plone 3 doesn't allow discussion of content without dynamic layouts,
      so migrate all the FTIs to dynamic view.
      [stevem]
    
    - Fixed issue #41, Content accessible when container is hidden.
      [stevem]
    
    - Consolidate ad-hoc topic css into stylesheet. (issue #78)
      [stevem]
    
    - Made it possible to use non-ASCII section titles (issues #80, #81, #83).
      [stevem]
    
    - Started building browser support; shifted much of the presentation
      logic for the PHC views to browser views.
      [stevem]
      
    - Fixed broken install under 2.5.x.
      [stevem]
    
    - A bug in CMF 1.2's DiscussionTool prevents setting a default
      allow_discussion via class attribute. (Archetypes used to work
      around this by catching the exception. That was lost in Archetypes
      1.5. Until fixed, commented out the code that sets allow_discussion.
      [stevem]
    
    - Add rudimentary test for comment mailing.
      [stevem]
    
    - Test and install cleanup targetting Plone 3.
      [stevem]
    
    PloneHelpCenter 1.0
    
    - Hide several visual artifacts that aid navigation on printed 
      media. 
      [servilio]
    
    - Using the stylesheet registry to include the custom styles,
      instead of including them directly from the templates.
      [servilio]
    
    - Fix issue #64: Topic area listings should be restricted to the HelpCenter
      [stevem].
      
    - Make import of CMFCorePermissions compatible with later versions of CMF
      [mj]
    
    - PHC tracker cleanup [stevem]:
      Fix issue #59: Images don't show in highest level nonpaginated view
       for a PloneHelpCenter manual.
      Fix for issues #44 and 52. Make view actions Plone 2.5 friendly.
      Fix issue #55 by adding contributed spanish .po files
      Fix issue #54: German Umlaute by updating .po files
      Fix issue #54: German Umlaute by updating .po file
      Fix issue #31: Token 'ATOM' required, 'Not' found in searches.
      Fix issue #62: Duplicated listings on content-type folders
      Fix issue #35, Contents fail to display if no section value assigned
    
    - Rephrase all-content-in-one-page view's note for reference
      manuals and tutorials to make it simple/shorter and avoid the
      ambiguity-prone "page" term (simple users might think it refers
      to print media, and might be surprised :O when it doesn't
      actually fit in one page).
      [Kathryn Hryb, servilio]
    
    - Added full contents view option to TOC drop-down for section
      views of reference manual and tutorial.
      [servilio]
    
    - Fixed some templates that weren't honouring the setting of
      site_properties.allowAnonymousViewAbout
      [servilio]
    
    - Fixed document actions placement for some templates that have
      them after the title.
      [servilio]
    
    - Make getRelatedItems return an empty list when no relatedItems
      property is present.
      [servilio]
    
    - Added search template for searches by topic, audience, version.
      [stevem]
    
    - Added option to make PHC searches be global rather than local-only.
      This will support including product-area documentation in searches
      on plone.org.
      [stevem]
    
    - Added HelpCenter templates to support browsing by section (topic).
      Added some support for using the section field for a
      "topic : subtopic" taxonomy. Added portlets to support these
      pages.
      [stevem, templates by vedawms, joelburton, and limi]
    
    - Added default sections at HelpCenter folder level. These may be
      overridden in folders.
      [stevem]
    
    - Added 'Start Here' flag for key documentation
      [aclark and stevem]
    
    PloneHelpCenter 0.9
    
    - i18n improvements and general fixes in some templates
      [ferri]
    
    - Added plone-pt-br.po and plonehelpcenter-pt-br.po
      [ferri]
    
    - Another template / i18n update.
      [hannosch]
    
    - Made it possible to have standalone objects outside the Help Center
      (very useful for reference manuals, for example)
      [limi]
    
    - Major overhaul of all i18n files.
      [hannosch]
    
    - actually start using the ADD_HELP_AREA_PERMISSION as the
      add permission for HelpCenter, instead of the generic
      'Add Portal Content' permission
      [rafrombrc]
    
    - fixed lots of failing and erroring unit tests.  got all
      tests to pass w/ plones 2.0 and 2.1
      [rafrombrc]
    
    - Made Glossary's getItemsBySection() return sorted list.
      [optilude]
    
    - Made reference manual and todo navigation drop-downs select current page
      [optilude]
    
    - Removed Help Center workflow from TutorialPages for now. They should
      probably just have a simple in-progress/finished marker workflow that
      doesn't really affect permissions, but just whether they are listed
      or not in the index/page navigation. Had to remove it because of permission
      problems right now (if any pages are not published in a Tutorial, you get
      permission denied on the entire Tutorial).
      [limi]
    
    PloneHelpCenter 0.2
    
    - Added Help Center portlet, this will aggregate published entries
      from all the available Help Centers, and display links to the published 
      help centers.
      [limi]
    
    - Added Glossary types, updated Help Center view
      [limi]
    
    - Added Link types
      [Joel]
    
    - Added ErrorReference types
      [Joel]
    
    - Added helpcenter_workflow & associate installation stuff.
      [Joel]
    
    - Cleaned up FAQFolder, HowtoFolder, TutorialFolder displays
      [Joel]
    
    - Folders now only list visible-to-users content
      [Joel]
    
    - Changed how versions are printed on pages: uses getVersions method
      rather than macro. Also, only prints a versions: line if there is
      anything in versions vocabulary--so, to create a help center that
      doesn't really use versions, just leave the vocab for this blank.
      It will still appear on Archetypes' forms, but won't show up
      one view modes
      [Joel]
    
    - Cleaned up and refactored text/doc files.
      [Joel]
    
    - Made many small API changes throughout. Sorry, but now this
      means that any existing Plone Help Centers will have to be migrated.
      I doubt if there are enough out there to justify making a 
      migration script. The API should be fairly stable from now on,
      but keep in mind this is still only a 0.2 release ;)
      [Joel]
    
    - added an optional ReferenceField (controlled in config.py) to cross-
      reference from a PHC-type to another Archetype in the portal. This 
      shouldnt affect existing code. If you have ATReferenceBrowserWidget
      installed its used instead of the dumb default ReferenceWidget.
      [Jensens]
    
    PloneHelpCenter 0.1
    
    - Development version
